How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

    After I typed "diff -u ...", there were some lines that showed the changes in the file.
    At the beginning of a line, the symbol "+", indicates the file was modified, new changes and
    the symbol "-",, those lines were removed.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By checking it as much as you can.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: It's easier with Git.
    Con: In Google Docs, you get confused when there are several versions of that file you can't manage.
    Pro: With only one command, nothing to worry about.
    Con: It's stressing looking for bugs.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	It's more comfortable and easier to check what changes have been made in the project by using Git.    


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	I type "git log" to see the new changes with commits.
	I type "git diff" to see the lines that were added and removed and see. That's how I see the differences.
    
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Confident.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For future projects I'm doing.
