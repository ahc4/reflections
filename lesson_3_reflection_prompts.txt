When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

    Fork: When I "clone" collaborate with someone's project on Github.
    Clone: When I "copy" someone's project on git (staging area).
    Branch: When I collect files on a folder.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If something happens like losing that or stopping doing the project, that's the solution.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
